Issues in the Code:

    Screen Not Cleared Before Redrawing:

        When you update the text on the cards, the old text is not cleared from
        the screen. This causes the new text to overlap with the old text,
        making it unreadable.

    Text Positioning:

        The shift_x and shift_y values in the draw method are hardcoded and may
        not align the text properly within the card.

    Event Loop Placement:

        The pygame.display.update() should be called after all drawing
        operations are complete, not at the beginning of the loop.

    Redrawing the Cards:

        The quest_card.draw(10, 25) and ans_card.draw(10, 25) calls inside the
        event loop are redundant. Instead, you should redraw the cards in the
        main loop after updating their text.

    Unnecessary Redraws:

        The quest_card.draw(10, 10) and ans_card.draw(10, 10) calls outside the
        main loop are unnecessary because the cards are already being drawn
        inside the loop.
